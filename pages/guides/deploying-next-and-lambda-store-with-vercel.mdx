[Lambda Store](https://lambda.store/) is a service that provides a managed Redis instance, providing high performance, low latency persistence for your app.

This guides showcases how to use Lambda Store with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to create a roadmap voting app, making use of the [Lambda Store integration](https://vercel.com/integrations/lambdastore) on Vercel, for a seamless setup and management experience.

## Step 1: Initialize the App Locally

To get started, initialize the application locally with following command:

<Snippet dark text="npx create-next-app --example with-redis with-redis-app" />

After initializing the app you can run it locally with the following command:

<Snippet dark text="yarn dev" />
<Caption>Running the Next.js + Lambda Store app locally.</Caption>

While your app will function well locally, there will be no persistence in the data. In [step 2](#step-2:-creating-an-api-key), you will create an API key which is required to connect the Lambda Store integration in [step 4](#step-4:-install-the-lambda-store-integration). This will enable data persistence for your app.

## Step 2: Creating an API Key

To create an API key, first create a new Lambda Store account [here](https://console.lambda.store/login) if you do not have one already.

After creating an account, select "Account" from the menu and click "API Keys" follwed by "Create An API Key".

Give your API key a name and confirm the creation - **make a note of this key when shown** as it will not visible again after this point.

<Note>
  If you lose your API key, you can always create another from the Lambda Store
  dashboard.
</Note>

In the next step, you will deploy the application initialized before shortly connecting it to the Lambda Store integration on Vercel.

## Step 3: Deploy the App with Vercel

<DeploySection meta={meta} />

## Step 4: Install the Lambda Store Integration

With your deployment made, install the [Lambda Store integration](/integrations/lambdastore) from the Vercel Dashboard, adding a configuration for the account you imported your project to.

When prompted, enter the email address associated with your Lambda Store account along with your API key from [step 2](#step-2:-creating-an-api-key) and click "Setup".

Select the [Project](/docs/platform/projects) to add the database for and click "+ Add Database".

Provide a database name, type, and region before clicking "Create". Once the database has been created, click "Link to project" to provide the `REDIS_URL` environment variable value to the Project.

From the next deployment created, the environment variable will be supplied to the app and you will have persistence provided by Lambda Store.
